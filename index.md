title: Tan Tran | AI Engineer & Researcher

## Welcome

I'm **Tan Tran** — an AI engineer, researcher, and lecturer who loves building systems that sit at the intersection of machine learning and real-world impact. From financial platforms to air traffic safety systems, I've spent years turning data into decisions.

This blog is where I share insights from the field: practical ML engineering, lessons from production AI systems, and thoughts on technology in Southeast Asia.

> *"Build systems that scale, write code that lasts, teach what you learn."*
